# ui-components Storybook Deployment Repository

This repository hosts the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) build output for **Nadoo.io's shared UI components**, which have been separated out for reuse across projects. It serves as the public documentation and showcase for these common components developed at Nadoo.io.

- Only static files generated by the Storybook build process are included; no source code is present.
- Deployment is fully automated using GitHub Actions: whenever the `main` branch is pushed, the build files are automatically redeployed to the `gh-pages` branch, which is published via GitHub Pages.
